# Term-Deposit

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits.

Term deposit accounts provide banks with the cash flow they need to lend money to other customers. The bank makes a profit by lending the funds held in time deposit accounts for a higher interest rate than the rate it pays on the time deposits.

So developing the predictive model for Term Deposit is one of the essential model to have.
